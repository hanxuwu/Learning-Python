# Uses data available at http://data.worldbank.org/indicator
# on Forest area (sq. km) and Agricultural land area (sq. km).
# Prompts the user for two distinct years between 1990 and 2004
# as well as for a strictly positive integer N,
# and outputs the top N countries where:
# - agricultural land area has increased from oldest input year to most recent input year;
# - forest area has increased from oldest input year to most recent input year;
# - the ratio of increase in agricultural land area to increase in forest area determines
#   output order.
# Countries are output from those whose ratio is largest to those whose ratio is smallest.
# In the unlikely case where many countries share the same ratio, countries are output in
# lexicographic order.
# In case fewer than N countries are found, only that number of countries is output.
