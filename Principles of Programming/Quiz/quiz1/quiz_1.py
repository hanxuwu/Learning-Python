'''
Generates a list L of random nonnegative integers smaller than the length of L,
whose value is input by the user, and outputs two lists:
- a list M consisting of L's middle element, followed by L's first element,
  followed by L's last element, followed by L's second element, followed by
  L's penultimate element...;
- a list N consisting of L[0], possibly followed by L[L[0]], possibly followed by
  L[L[L[0]]]..., for as long as L[L[0]], L[L[L[0]]]... are unused, and then,
  for the least i such that L[i] is unused, followed by L[i], possibly followed by
  L[L[i]], possibly followed by L[L[L[i]]]..., for as long as L[L[i]], L[L[L[i]]]...
  are unused, and then, for the least j such that L[j] is unused, followed by L[j],
  possibly followed by L[L[j]], possibly followed by L[L[L[j]]]..., for as long as
  L[L[j]], L[L[L[j]]]... are unused... until all members of L have been used up.
