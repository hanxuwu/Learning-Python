# Randomly fills a grid of size 10 x 10 with digits between 0
# and bound - 1, with bound provided by the user.
# Given a point P of coordinates (x, y) and an integer "target"
# also all provided by the user, finds a path starting from P,
# moving either horizontally or vertically, in either direction,
# so that the numbers in the visited cells add up to "target".
# The grid is explored in a depth-first manner, first trying to move north,
# always trying to keep the current direction,
# and if that does not work turning in a clockwise manner.
