# Written by *** and Eric Martin for COMP9021


'''
Generates a list L of random nonnegative integers, the largest possible value
and the length of L being input by the user, and generates:
- a list "fractions" of strings of the form 'a/b' such that:
    . a <= b;
    . a*n and b*n both occur in L for some n
    . a/b is in reduced form
  enumerated from smallest fraction to largest fraction
  (0 and 1 are exceptions, being represented as such rather than as 0/1 and 1/1);
- if "fractions" contains then 1/2, then the fact that 1/2 belongs to "fractions";
- otherwise, the member "closest_1" of "fractions" that is closest to 1/2,
  if that member is unique;
- otherwise, the two members "closest_1" and "closest_2" of "fractions" that are closest to 1/2,
  in their natural order.
