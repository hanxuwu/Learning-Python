# Randomly generates N distinct integers with N provided by the user,
# inserts all these elements into a priority queue, and outputs a list
# L consisting of all those N integers, determined in such a way that:
# - inserting the members of L from those of smallest index of those of
#   largest index results in the same priority queue;
# - L is preferred in the sense that the last element inserted is as large as
#   possible, and then the penultimate element inserted is as large as possible, etc.
