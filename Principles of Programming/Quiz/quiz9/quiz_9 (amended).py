# Generates a binary tree T whose shape is random and whose nodes store
# random even positive integers, both random processes being directed by user input.
# With M being the maximum sum of the nodes along one of T's branches, minimally expands T
# to a tree T* such that:
# - every inner node in T* has two children, and
# - the sum of the nodes along all of T*'s branches is equal to M.
